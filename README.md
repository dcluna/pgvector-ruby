[![Build Status](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-ruby/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-ruby/actions)

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "pgvector"
```

And follow the instructions for your database library:

- [pg](#pg)
- [Sequel](#sequel) [unreleased]

## pg

Register the vector type with your connection

```ruby
registry = PG::BasicTypeRegistry.new.define_default_types
Pgvector::PG.register_vector(registry)
conn.type_map_for_results = PG::BasicTypeMapForResults.new(conn, registry: registry)
```

Insert a vector

```ruby
embedding = [1, 2, 3]
conn.exec_params("INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ($1)", [embedding])
```

Get the nearest neighbors to a vector

```ruby
conn.exec_params("SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> $1 LIMIT 5", [embedding]).to_a
```

## Sequel

Create a table

```ruby
DB.create_table :items do
  primary_key :id
  column :embedding, "vector(3)"
end
```

Insert a vector

```ruby
DB[:items].insert(embedding: Pgvector.encode([1, 1, 1]))
```

Get the nearest neighbors to a vector

```ruby
DB[:items].order(Sequel.lit("embedding <-> ?", Pgvector.encode([1, 1, 1]))).limit(5).all
```
